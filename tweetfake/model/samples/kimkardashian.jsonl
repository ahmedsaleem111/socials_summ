This week @realtristan13 and I had an inspiring Friendsgiving dinner with the young men incarcerated at Camp Kilpatrick. These young men have earned their way to this model camp in Malibu for great behavior. Many are in college classes and have made huge changes in their life. My favorite part at our dinner was going around the table and hearing what their dreams and aspirations are. I can‚Äôt wait to see them all come true. Thank you to the staff at the facility and to @antirecidivismcoalition, @scottbudnick1 and @swlewis01 for having me. Happy Thanksgiving to all of the men and women that are away from their families this year. A special shout out to Darius, William, Matthew, Tony, Carlos, Daniel, Monte, Matthew, Alan, Kevin, Carlos down at Camp Kilpatrick. I love you guys!","_Post__location":null}

I‚Äôve known about Baby 2 Baby for a decade and have seen @kellysawyer and @norahweinstein build this incredible organization to help so many family across the country but to be there for my first event was magical. Thank you for all of the amazing work Baby 2 Baby does to help so many families in need. Thank you to @tylerperry for presenting me this honor. You are the most generous and supportive friend there is. It was a record breaking year from all of the support and I urge people to continue to help the families in our community. It was so much fun celebrating with family and dancing to @diddy with the lifers, I cannot wait for us to all come together again for next year‚Äôs event.","_Post__location":null}
